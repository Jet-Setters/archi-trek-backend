# archi-trek-backend

This is the backend server for the Archi-Trek app. This server will take in requests from the app
and route them to the appropriate api to request data on behalf of the frontend.

In order for the backend server to work for the app, you need to 'npm i express cors dotenv axios' on the 
commandline in the file where this will run.
You will need to create a .env file on the root of the server and put in: PORT=3002;

This server was setup by Rachel Freeland, Anvay Bhanap, and Jessica Parker.
